# Ride_Data_Analysis_Project
Analyzed ride-sharing data to extract insights on trip patterns, peak hours, and popular routes. Handled missing values, visualized trends with line charts and maps, and identified top-performing regions. Built a data-driven view to optimize ride operations and improve decision-making.
